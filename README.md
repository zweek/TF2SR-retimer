# TF2SR-retimer
This is a very basic tool that just lets you enter a bunch of segment timestamps and it'll do some math to let you retime runs based on those timestamps. VERY much a work in progress and more of a learning exercise than anything tbh lol.

# How to use
- No dependencies, just plain Javascript!
- Download the source code and run the `index.html` file to run the page locally.
- how does web hosting work lmao idk
